Usage:

    tcp [-s] [-q] [-bSIZE] SERVICE [HOST]

Create TCP/IP connection to SERVICE of HOST, default `localhost`.

  -s — Be a server (bind(2), listen(2), accept(2)), rather than a client
    (connect(2)).  Handles clients one by one.  Terminate with Ctrl+C.

  -q — Quit after serving first client, implies `-s`.

  -bSIZE — Buffer for read(2) and write(2), defaults to 1024, accepts
     metric and binary suffix.

When a peer disconnects (Ctrl+D without input, or Ctrl+C), then the
client terminates, the server accepts the next client (unless `-q`).
