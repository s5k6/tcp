Usage (order of arguments is fixed):

    tcp [-s] PORT [ADDRESS [SIZE]]

Connects to (or listens on, if `-s` is present) the given port, where
ADDRESS defaults to localhost.  read(2) and write(2) use a buffer of
SIZE bytes, defaulting to 1024.

The server accepts clients one by one.  Both, client and server, will
terminate when the peer disconnects, usually triggered by pressing C-d
(aka. ^D).
