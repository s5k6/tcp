Establish TCP/IP communication on PORT (by number or by name) of
localhost (default) or HOST (by address or by name) if specified.

    tcp [-s] PORT [HOST] -- COMMAND...
    tcp [-s] PORT [HOST] [-bSIZE] [-q]

The order of mandatory arguments is relevant.

The first form runs COMMAND when the connection is established, with
the socket for stdin/stdout.  The server (`-s`) spawns a child for
each connection, the client replaces itself with the command.

The second form uses stdin/stdout for buffered IO.  The buffer's SIZE
defaults to `1ki` bytes.  With `-q` any shutdown(2) closes the
connection.  The server (`-s`) only accepts clients sequentially.
