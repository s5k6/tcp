Establish TCP/IP communication on PORT (by number or by name) of
localhost, or HOST (by address or by name) if specified.

    tcp [-s] PORT [HOST] -- COMMAND...
    tcp [-s] PORT [HOST] [-bSIZE] [-q]

When present, the order of PORT, HOST, `--` and COMMAND is mandatory.

If present, the COMMAND is run when the connection is established,
with its standard IO replaced by the socket file descriptor, and
inheriting stderr from `tcp`.  The server (`-s`) spawns a child for
each connection, the client replaces itself with the command.

Otherwise, the standard streams of the `tcp` process are used for
buffered IO.  Unless `-q` is given, the connection may be half-closed.
Ths buffer's SIZE defaults to `1k` in bytes.  The server (`-s`) only
accepts clients one by one.
