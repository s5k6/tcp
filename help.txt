Usage:

    tcp [-s] [-q] [-bSIZE] SERVICE [HOST]

Create TCP/IP connection to SERVICE of HOST, default `localhost`.

  -s — Be a server, rather than a client.  Handles clients one by one.
    Terminate with Ctrl+C.

  -q — Quit after serving first client, implies `-s`.

  -bSIZE — Buffer size for all reading and writing, defaults to 1024,
    accepts metric and binary suffix.

When a peer disconnects (Ctrl+D without input, or Ctrl+C), then the
client terminates, the server accepts the next client (unless `-q`).
